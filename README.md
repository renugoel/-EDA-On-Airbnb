# -EDA-On-Airbnb
Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in that locale. 
For this project we are analyzing Airbnbâ€™s New York City(NYC) data of 2019.
We have analyzed this dataset from different angles and have come up with interesting insights.
This can help in making strategic data-driven decisions by the marketing team, 
finance team and technical team of Airbnb.
